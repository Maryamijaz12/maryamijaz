        <h1><I><U>My Self</U></I></h1>
        <p >My name is <b>MaryamIjaz</b>. <br>I am <b>24</b> years old.<br>I am from<b> Kharick Rawalakot</b> .
            <br>I completed my FSC from <b>Islamia Model College </b>.
            <br>I completed my degree Software
            Engineering from <b>University of Poonch Rawalakot</b>.<br>

              <h1><I><U>My Goals</U></I> </h1>
              <p >The Aim is a target or purpose that every person has in life. <br>
                It directs a person and motivates them to achieve them.<br>
              Every Individual must set well-defined objectives to achieve in life.<br>
            It helps them to understand the <small>career</small>  path and motivates them to move forward.<br>
                A goal in life gives a person enough joy and <em>happiness</em>  and sets a leading example for others to live life in the best possible manner.<br>
                To achieve your goals, you need to set the right purpose and <sup>break</sup> them into small sections and prepare a timeline to make them.<br>
                A person with a thirst to achieve must be <mark>proactive</mark> , embrace failure, be well-balanced, and <sub>tell </sub>people about your goals with confidence.<br> Stay positive and keep track of your goals.<br>
                Avoid all negativity around you, seek guidance when needed from others, be open to feedback and criticisms, and reset your goal.<br>
                 My Aim in life is to become a <strong>teacher</strong> as I consider it as the noblest of all the professions.<br> A teacher serves his/her society and country in their best possible way.</p>
