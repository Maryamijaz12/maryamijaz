              <h1><I><U>My Goals</U></I> </h1>
              <p style="color:blue">The Aim is a target or purpose that every person has in life. <br>
                It directs a person and motivates them to achieve them.<br>
              Every Individual must set well-defined objectives to achieve in life.<br>
            It helps them to understand the career path and motivates them to move forward.<br>
                A goal in life gives a person enough joy and<em>happiness</em>  and sets a leading example for others to live life in the best possible manner.<br>
                To achieve your goals, you need to set the right purpose and break them into small sections and prepare a timeline to make them.<br>
                A person with a thirst to achieve must be proactive, embrace failure, be well-balanced, and tell people about your goals with confidence.<br> Stay positive and keep track of your goals.<br>
                Avoid all negativity around you, seek guidance when needed from others, be open to feedback and criticisms, and reset your goal.<br>
                 My Aim in life is to become a <strong>teacher</strong> as I consider it as the noblest of all the professions.<br> A teacher serves his/her society and country in their best possible way.</p>
